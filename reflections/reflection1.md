## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We completed the Todo page and Recap page which were our MVP's for the project.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Gikai: Fixing the side bar for the login page and formatting everything the same way as the register page was, since we had two people work on it separately even though one person should've been assigned both features since they were so similar.
 Stephane: Getting the different modals to show up and correctly work as forms was complicated because although the forms were separate, they still depended on each other. For example, if a user wanted to update a task, we would prefill the input fields with the values that were already stored in the task. And if they made edits and updated it, we would have to change the original task, and so on. 
 Kian: A fun challenge I enjoyed was learning how to use chart.js and being able to customize the different graphs to display exactly how our group wanted them to look like.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We were able to complete our entire sprint plus a couple issues that pertained to next week's sprint.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Yes, Anitya suggested the first day to use chart.js along with some other resources. And although the other resources were handy, we felt that chart.js was the most functional for the job we wanted to complete.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Right now, we wouldn't consider any of the user stories at risk since we are at good pace. Right now, we simply want to finish our dashboard so it is fully functional but that depends on the backend being done for the social media. We also want to make a social media page which needs to wait until backend is done as well. However, backend should not take a lot of time to finish so that is why we don't consider it at risk.
