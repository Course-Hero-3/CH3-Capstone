## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We were able to finish our dashboard, implement social page, and add a profile page for users to edit their information.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Some challenges we faced were formatting all of the cards in the dashboard and also being able to follow other users and immediately updating the social page when doing so. Another difficult thing was changing the password for a user.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 Yes, we finished our whole sprint plan for this week. Now, we will fine tune things for next week and make everything look extra professional.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Yes, we will use nodemailer in order to notify users for upcoming tasks 1 day before the due date and time so that they don't forget.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 None would be at risk, we have almost finished every user story now we just need to make each story's wants and needs as smooth functioning as possible.
